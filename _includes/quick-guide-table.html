  <div class="steps">1. Is SDA the right archive?
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div> 
  <div>
    Assess whether SDA is the right place for your data. The repository is for
    sharing sensitive human data that requires controlled access, which means
    that formal applications must be made to access submitted files.
    Furthermore, only certain data types are accepted. Learn more about how to
    <a href="../is-sda-suitable.html"> assess whether SDA is suitable or not</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">2. Create a submission request
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    The SDA is under development and can currently only handle a limited number
    of submission requests. If you consider SDA to be the right place for your
    data and want to be added to our waiting list, please fill in the 
    <a href="https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php#sdaform">SDA
    submission request webform</a>. The SDA Helpdesk will evaluate your request 
    and get back to you regarding how to proceed.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">
    3. Receive credentials for a submission account at Central EGA
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    After you have received a confirmation from the SDA Helpdesk to proceed
    with your submission, SDA Helpdesk will request a submission account for you
    at Central EGA. Using the received credentials, you should be
    able to log in to the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">
    EGA Submitter Portal</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">4. Register Study, Sample, DAC and Policy
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Use the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">
    EGA Submitter Portal</a> to register your Study, Samples, Data Access 
    Committee (DAC) and Policy (with Data Access Agreement [DAA]).
  </div>

  <div class="steps">5. Encrypt and upload data
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Follow the <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs">
    SDA-specific instructions on GitHub</a> on how to encrypt files, calculate
    checksums and upload data.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">6. Register Experiments and Runs
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Associate each data file with a registered sample and study by linking files
    to samples in the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">
    EGA Submitter Portal</a>. Details of the experimental procedure you followed
    must be provided.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">7. Finish your submission
    <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Group your runs/analysis into datasets and link them to your new or existing
    Data Access Committee (DAC) and Data Access Agreement (DAA) using the 
    <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">
    EGA Submitter Portal</a>. Data requests are done at a dataset level, thus
    files within a dataset must share release conditions.
  </div>

  <div class="steps">8. Release the data</div>
  <div>
    Instruct the SDA Helpdesk to release your study. All registered studies are 
    automatically placed on hold until the named submission or Data Access 
    Committee (DAC) contact instructs the SDA Helpdesk for the study to be
    released.
