<div class = "flex-container">
  <div class="steps">1. Is SDA the right archive? <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div></div> 
  <div>Assess whether SDA is the right place for your data. The SDA can only take certain types of data and the data submitted to the repository must require controlled access. Read about how to <a href="../is-sda-suitable.html">find out if SDA is suitable or not</a>.</div>
  <div class="steps">2. Create a submission request <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div></div> 
  <div>The SDA is under development and only able to handle a limited number of submission requests. If you think that SDA is the right place for your data and want to be added to our waiting list, please fill in the <a href="https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php#sdaform">SDA submission request webform</a>. SDA Helpdesk will contact you as soon as we are ready to start working on your submission.</div>
  <div class="steps">3. Get a submission account at Central EGA<div class="arrow arrow-down"></div></div>
  <div>Once you receive a confirmation from the SDA Helpdesk to proceed with your submission, you need to request an account at Central EGA. Send an email to the <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ega-archive.org?subject=Account for submitting data to the Swedish node of FEGA">EGA Helpdesk</a> and ask for an account for submitting data to the Swedish node of the Federated EGA. Using the received credentials, you should be able to log in to the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">EGA Submitter Portal</a>.</div>
  <div class="steps">4. Register Study, Sample, DAC and Policy <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div> </div>
  <div >Use the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">EGA Submitter Portal</a> to register your Study, Samples, Data Access Committee (DAC) and Policy (with Data Access Agreement [DAA]).</div>
  <div class="steps">5. Encrypt and upload data <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div> </div>
  <div >Follow the <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs">SDA-specific instructions on GitHub</a> on how to encrypt files, calculate checksums and upload data.</div>
  <div class="steps">6. Register experiments and runs <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div> </div>
  <div >Associate each data file with a registered sample and study by linking files to samples in the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">EGA Submitter Portal</a>. Details of the experimental procedure you followed must also be provided.</div>
  <div class="steps">7. Finish your submission <div class="arrow arrow-down"></div> </div>
  <div >Group your runs/analysis into datasets and link them to your new or existing Data Access Committee (DAC) and Data Access Agreement (DAA) using the <a href="https://ega-archive.org/submission/tools/submitter-portal">EGA Submitter Portal</a>. Data requests are done at a dataset level, thus files within a dataset must share release conditions.</div>
  <div class="steps">8. Release the data</div>
  <div>Instruct the SDA Helpdesk to release your study. All registered studies are automatically placed on hold until the named submission or Data Access Committee (DAC) contact instructs the SDA Helpdesk for the study to be released.</div>
