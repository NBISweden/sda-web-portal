The Data Access Committee (DAC) decides whether access will be granted to a
requested dataset or not. The DAC consist of one or more named individuals who
act on behalf of the data controller. A DAC may be affiliated with one or
multiple datasets. For a submission to be complete, a DAC must be specified in
the EGA Submitter Portal.  

As the first step, contact each DAC member to receive a confirmation of the
appointment. Thereafter, inform the Swedish FEGA helpdesk about the identity of
the DAC members including full name, affiliation and email address. The helpdesk
will thereafter verify the identity and contact details of the DAC members and
confirm the acceptance of their appointments.

When entering the DAC record in the EGA Submitter Portal, the DAC should be
given a name which is informative. For each DAC member, specify the name and 
institutional email address. Also, specify the main DAC contact.
