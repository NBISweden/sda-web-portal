To fulfill the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
you need to make sure that there is a data processing agreement between each
data controller and Uppsala University (i.e. the host institution of FEGA
Sweden). For convenience, we have already established general data processing
agreements with some Swedish universities (see below). If the data controller of
your data has not signed a general data processing agreement with us, a new
agreement will have to be established. The data protection officer (DPO) at your
institution may be able help you with that. If Uppsala University is the only
data controller, there is no need of a data processing agreement.

### Established agreements

General data processing agreements between Uppsala University and other Swedish
universities for depositing data in FEGA Sweden are listed below. The
registration number ("diarienummer") at Uppsala University is given in
parantheses. All agreements are in Swedish.
