Before you start working on a submission, you should ask yourself whether FEGA
Sweden is the right place for storing and sharing your data. This guide will
help you assess the suitability of FEGA Sweden. If you need help with the
assessment, please contact the <a href="mailto:ega-se@nbis.se">Helpdesk</a>.


## Is my data of the right type?

FEGA Sweden aims to store the same kind of data as the central European-phenome
Archive (EGA), which basically means any data resulting from biomedical research
projects. You can read more about data types and file formats at [EGA](https://ega-archive.org).

## Does my data require controlled access?

Sensitive personal data can normally not be shared publicly due to legal and
ethical constraints. FEGA Sweden makes it possible to share sensitive personal
data under controlled access. This means that access to any submitted file will
be determined by a formal application procedure. If your data does not require
controlled access, you should consider submitting it to an alternative
repository, such as the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/submit).


## Is my data from a Swedish research project?

FEGA Sweden is a national node of the [Federated EGA](https://ega-archive.org/federated)
that primarily hosts data from Swedish research projects. You are welcome to
contact the [Helpdesk](mailto:ega-se@nbis.se) if you want to discuss alternative
strategies for sharing your data.


## Am I allowed to share the data through FEGA Sweden?

If you plan to make personally identifiable data accessible to others, there are
some special legislations that you have to be aware of. For Swedish research
projects, these include for example the [Swedish Ethical Review Act](ethical-approval-and-consent)
and the [General Data Protection Regulation](complying-with-gdpr) (GDPR).
