If you wish to share your data via FEGA Sweden, there are several things you can
do in advance to facilitate the submission process. Use the checklist below to
ensure that you have everything you need to succeed with your submission. If you
have any questions, please write to the [Helpdesk](mailto:ega-se@nbis.se).

* Consider which data you would like to share via FEGA Sweden. The submission
  process will be less complicated if you know which files to include in your
  submission.
* Determine [if FEGA Sweden is the right archive](is-fega-sweden-the-right-archive)
  for your data.
* Find out what is needed in order to [comply with GDPR](complying-with-gdpr).
* Make sure that the [ethical approval](ethical-approval) allows
  the data to be shared via FEGA Sweden.
* Consider if the data should be divided into multiple datasets.
  [Access to data in FEGA Sweden](/access) is given at the dataset level, which
  means that all files in a dataset must share the same release conditions.
* [Prepare your data files](preparing-data) so that they are ready to be submitted.
* Collect and [prepare the metadata](preparing-metadata), including the
  data access policy.
* Identify and contact the people that you would like to include in the
  [Data Access Committee](appointing-a-dac) (DAC).
