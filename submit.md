## How do I submit data?

In preparation for submission you need to verify that a data
processing agreement between the data producing university and Uppsala
University is in place. A list of established such data processing
agreements can be found [here](https://nbis.se/support/general-processing-agreements.html). If no
suitable agreement is listed, contact the Data Protection Officer at
your university to establish one.

Another preparatory step for submission is to encrypt your data. The
public key for the archive (used for encrypting before uploads) is
availabe [here](https://github.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs/blob/main/crypt4gh_key.pub). Upload
instructions are currently available [on GitHub](
https://github.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs/blob/main/README.md).


### User documentation
The first step to submit data to the Swedish Sensitive Data Archive is to submit a request [here](https://dbampalikis.github.io/request.html). Once the request has been approved, please follow the instructions about encrypting and uploading the files in [this repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs).
