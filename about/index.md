Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA) is a service for storing and
sharing all types of biomedical data, including genome and phenome datasets,
consented for research but with restricted access. FEGA allows you to store
datasets in Sweden in a way that fulfills all the requirements of the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A Data Access Committee (DAC) processes
access requests for datasets and decides based on the purpose and ethical
permits for your research project. 

Swedish FEGA is a national service based on the central European Genome-phenome
Archive (EGA). FEGA Sweden is hosted by the National Bioinformatics
Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS) which is the Swedish [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org)
node. ELIXIR unites Europeâ€™s leading life science organizations in managing and
safeguarding the increasing volume of data being generated by publicly funded
research.You can upload your data and the public metadata of your study to the
Swedish FEGA. The study metadata will be made internationally available at EGA,
which increases the impact of your research data. Swedish FEGA and EGA are free
of charge for academic users.
