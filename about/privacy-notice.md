## Privacy and Data Protection Policies

The SDA is hosted by NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) and is
consequently subject to this organisation's [Privacy Policy](https://nbis.se/about/privacy.html).
Since NBIS belongs to Uppsala University, you can also find information about
the processing of personal data in the university's 
[Data Protection Policy](https://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/data-protection-policy/).


## General Data Processing Agreements

When researchers from universities other than Uppsala University wish to submit
data to SDA, NBIS/Uppsala University will act as Processor for the Controller
(which is the university where the researcher is employed). In such cases, an
agreement must be established between the Controller and the Processor according
to [Article 28 (3)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

To simplify data submission, we have established general processing agreements
between NBIS/Uppsala University and some Swedish universities.

 (see Case 3).
