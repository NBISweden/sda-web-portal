Our helpdesk team offers service in terms of general support, handling of submission requests and data access requests. We work in close collaboration with the user providing stepwise guidance and support from start to end of the submitter and data access request journeys. Each issue is handled by an individual helpdesk officer, thereby ensuring a time efficient process where we and the user are continuously updating each other on the progression of the submission and data access request process.
