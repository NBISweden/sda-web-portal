Swedish FEGA is a national federated infrastructure to store and share human genome and phenome datasets.

There is an increasing number of patient genomes and related data types, such as transcriptomes or single cell analysis, processed in research and health care initiatives in Sweden. Swedish FEGA is a national resource for data controllers to safely archiving, accessing and sharing these data, which previously has been missing in Sweden. Swedish FEGA employs the FAIR principles for data sharing, thereby making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable and follows Sweden’s and Europe’s data protection requirements.  

## Data sharing

Human genome and phenome data is currently collected from patients across Sweden and beyond, but it has been difficult for researchers to access the data they require, or to safely share the data that they have generated. Swedish FEGA will bring these data together and make them easier to find, thereby enabling researchers to create new cohorts to help validate their findings and may provide opportunities for new and novel Big Data techniques. These opportunities will facilitate further biological discovery and will help to translate research findings into the clinical routine, benefitting patients and adding further value to genomic medicine. 

## Data protection 

As a national resource, Swedish FEGA addresses the legal and ethical requirements specific to Sweden and provides a framework for secure data-sharing. Thereby, Swedish FEGA will ensure that patient data are secure whilst still being used for research purposes. Through engaging and involving patients and the public, Swedish FEGA aims to build trust beyond the scientific community, and to keep patients at the heart of our work.
