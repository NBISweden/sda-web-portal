This page describes how you request access to datasets deposited in SDA. For
any questions regarding data access, please contact the 
<a href="mailto:ega-se@nbis.se">SDA Helpdesk</a>.

Each dataset stored in the SDA is affiliated with a Data Access Committee (DAC),
which is the body responsible for all data access decisions.
