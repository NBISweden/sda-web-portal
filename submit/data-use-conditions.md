Data use conditions specify the conditions under which a dataset to which access
has been granted can be used by a requester. FEGA Sweden uses Data Use
Ontology (DUO) codes to specify these conditions which is the model employed by
the EGA. For a submission to be complete, DUO codes must be specified together
with the Policy. Select maximum one primary DUO code and any number of secondary
codes. Inform the EGA helpdesk about the selected DUO codes. The EGA helpdesk
will then register the codes in the EGA Submitter Portal.
